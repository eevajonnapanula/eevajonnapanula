# Heippa! :wave: (Hello in Finnish :finland:)

Short about me:
- I'm software developer and accessibility specialist
- I work at Oura Health
- I blog and speak at meetups and conferences
- When not coding or sharing my knowledge, I play ultimate frisbee and explore the world by foot and a kayak.

You can find more about me from [my website.](https://eevis.codes)

  She loves hooomans, and petting. This is how happy she is right now:
